Fullstack practice app I created to practice Vue while using the Jobs API I created a little while ago. This web app includes a login system and CRUD functionality to store and display jobs the user lists down.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
